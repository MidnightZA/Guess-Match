# Guess-Match

There are 2 twos of hidden letters (A to J) in a table:

The objective of the game is to guess a position (1 - 10) in row 1 and then a position in row 2 (1 - 10), attempting to match all the letters in row 1 and row 2,

The player will get to decide how may tries they will like. Lower tries = harder game

Match all and Win
